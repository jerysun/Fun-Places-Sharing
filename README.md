# Fun Places Sharing

Fun Places Sharing aims to make a social hub to introduce to each other the fun places they have been, distinguishing from its rivals with the easiest operation and best interaction. It's built using MERN(MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js) stack.

## Some features:
- Reactive design, self adaptive to PCs, laptops, iPads, mobile phones, etc.
- Use the REST APIs. 
- Components construct like LEGO bricks
- Integrated with Google map

Have fun,
